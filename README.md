# CS201-202 Assignments

**DISCLAIMER:** All the work here has been shared on GitHub to create an archive of materials from the CS201 and CS202 courses. You should not use those codes for your academic studies. Otherwise, you will do nothing but deceive yourself.

This repository consists of my solutions to every single work in Bilkent University CS201 and CS202 courses. During my sophomore year, I took the courses from Asst. Prof. Dr. A. E. Çiçek and Dr. E. K. Tabak (ex-HAVELSAN, Udemy), respectively, in the 2021-2022 academic year.

## Structure

All assignments are organized in the following order:

```txt
CS20x/
├── HW1/
├── HW2/
├── HW3/
└── HW4/
    ├── ...
    ├── ...
    └── README.md
```

The corresponding instructions for every assignment can be found in the ``README.md`` file in their own folder.
